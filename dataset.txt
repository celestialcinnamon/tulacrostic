Most days I wake up with a pit in my chest
There are thoughts that I can't put to rest
There's a worry that I can't place
Most nights I am restless, and quiet won't come
So I lay there and wait for the sun
There's a trouble that won't show its face

You came out of nowhere
And you cut through all the noise
I make sense of the madness
When I listen to your voice

Darlin', only you can ease my mind
Help me leave these lonely thoughts behind
When they pull me under
And I can feel my sanity start to unwind
Darlin' only you can ease my mind

I'll admit, for a moment I felt so afraid
Just to show you the mess that I made
There are pieces I usually hide
But when you collect me with your steady hand
With a language that I understand
I feel put back together inside

You came out of nowhere
And you cut through all the noise
I make sense of the madness
When I listen to your voice

Oh darlin', only you can ease my mind
Oh help me leave these lonely thoughts behind
When they pull me under
And I can feel my sanity start to unwind
Darlin' only you can ease my mind

Darlin', only you can ease my mind
Help me leave these lonely thoughts behind
When they pull me under
And I can feel my sanity start to unwind
Darlin' only you can ease my mind 

You always said that I'd come back to you again
'Cause everybody needs a friend, it's true
Someone to quiet the voices in my head
Make 'em sing to me instead, it's you

Hate to say that I love you
Hate to say that I need you
Hate to say that I want you
But I do

Bad habit, I know
But I'm needin' you right now
Can you help me out?
Can I lean on you?
Been one of those days
Sun don't wanna come out
Can you help me out?
Can I lean on you?

You make me feel like I'm floatin' off the ground
Above this little town, you do
Look at me smile with tears in my eyes
I love the way you lie, I do

Hate to say that I'm lonely
Hate to say that I miss you
Hate to say that it's dark in here
But it's true, oh

Bad habit, I know
But I'm needin' you right now
Can you help me out?
Can I lean on you?
Been one of those days
Sun don't wanna come out
Can you help me out?
Can I lean on you?

Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Can I lean on you?
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Can I lean on you?

Hate to say that I'm lonely
Hate to say that I miss you
Hate to say that it's dark in here
But it's true, oh

Bad habit, I know
But I'm needin' you right now
Can you help me out?
Can I lean on you?

Can I lean on you?
You
Can I lean on you?

Hate to say that I love you
Hate to say that I need you
Hate to say that I want you
But I do 

You're afraid to need someone
'Cause you been burned, you been burned, you've been burned
Love is good until it's gone
That's what you learned, what you've learned, what you've learned

You don't have to hide your love away and
I know that I'm gonna make mistakes but
Leaning on somebody isn't easy
I'll do what I can to make you see, oh

This is not a temporary love
This is not a temporary love
Now your heart is in my hands
I won't give it up
This is not a temporary love

You may not think I know the difference
But I do, but I do, but I do
I feel the gravity between us
And you can too, you can too, you can too

We don't have to hide our love away and
Both of us are gonna make mistakes 'cause
Leaning on somebody's never easy
But look at me and tell me you don't see, oh

This is not a temporary love
No, this is not a temporary love
Now your heart is in my hands
I won't give it up
This is not a temporary love

When the world around is caving in
And the winds, well they keep on changing
Take my hand and let it spin
We'll hold still

This is not a temporary love
This is not a temporary love
Now my heart is in your hands
Please don't give it up
This is not a temporary love

This is not a temporary love
No, this is not a temporary love
Now your heart is in my hands
Please don't give it up
This is not a temporary love

This is not a temporary love 

You say there's so much you don't know
You need to go and find yourself
You say you'd rather be alone
'Cause you think you won't find it tied to someone else

Who said it's true,
That the growing only happens on your own?
They don't know me and you

I don't think you have to leave
If to change is what you need
You can change right next to me
When you're high I'll take the lows
You can ebb and I can flow
And we'll take it slow
And grow as we go, ooh
Grow as we go, ooh

You won't be the only one
I am unfinished, I've got so much left to learn
I don't know how this river runs
But I'd like the company through every twist and turn

Who said it's true,
That the growing only happens on your own?
They don't know me and you

You don't ever have to leave
If to change is what you need
You can change right next to me
When you're high I'll take the lows
You can ebb and I can flow
And we'll take it slow
And grow as we go, ooh
And grow as we go, ooh
And grow as we go, ooh
And grow as we go, ooh

I don't know who we'll become
I can't promise it's not written in the stars
But I believe that when it's done
We're gonna see that it was better
That we grew up together

Tell me you don't wanna leave
'Cause if change is what you need
You can change right next to me
When you're high I'll take the lows
You can ebb and I can flow
And we'll take it slow
And grow as we go, oh
And grow as we go, oh
And grow as we go, oh
And grow as we go, ooh

There's something about you in the moonlight
But your eyes go so well with the day
You won't let go of your layers
But your power can strip me away

It's easier for us to hide
If you come out then so will I
Promise that I'll meet you halfway
Cause I see every part of you
And I can tell you see me too
By the way that you say my name

I'm an honest man
Why can't you take my hand
I'm not what you planned
But I'm a safe place to land
I'm an honest man

You're so afraid of tomorrow
So you build your walls of today
You won't believe that you're ready
But I'd never lead you astray

It's easier for us to hide
If you come out then so will I
Promise that I'll meet you halfway
Cause I see every part of you
And I can tell you see me too
By the way that you say my name

I'm an honest man
Why can't you take my hand
I'm not what you planned
But I'm a safe place to land
I'm an honest man
See me as I am
Show me that I can
You make me an honest man

I know I've played with hearts before
Don't have the heart to play with yours
I only swear to do the best I can
Cause when you put your trust in me
How beautiful our love could be
If only you would take a chance

I'm an honest man
Why won't you take my hand
I'm not what you planned
But I'm a safe place to land
I'm an honest man

I'm an honest man
Why won't you hold my hand
I'm not what you planned
I'm a safe place to land
I'm an honest man
See me as I am
Show me I can
You make me an honest man

I've said all I can
I am who I am
And I am an honest man 

I'm sure it was nothing
But you never used to bring somebody else along
Used to be our thing
Going to a movie, then we wander home
All these little landmines
All these little things that one can read two ways
Like when you take every call outside
Seems that I've forgotten how to read your face
But I know you too well to get it wrong

If you have to hurt me, hurt me once
If you have to end it, get it done
You have all these choices, I have none
You're all that I have to lose
Couldn't hurt you if I wanted to
I've decided on you

If you keep it going
Then one by one, the memories will start to blur
You'll ruin the good ones
But I guess my photo album's none of your concern
Don't humor me with kindness
There's nothing kind about a hundred small betrayals
If you love me at all, you'll kill it now

If you have to hurt me, hurt me once
If you have to end it, get it done
You have all these choices, I have none
You're all that I have to lose
Couldn't hurt you if I wanted to
I decided on you, I've decided on you

And if I'm disappointed
It's 'cause you're not the person I knew
If I had it my way, I'd be kinder than you
I'm sure I'll forgive you, and soon
I'm ashamed that I'm proud of it, too
I decided on you

Wish that I'd known this feeling was coming
When I was crying over you
Now that you're gone, I carry nothing
It feels like flying

Boy, I used to throw a party over every little thing you'd do
Never going back, never going back to that
Heartsick little lover boy who went and lost himself in you
'Cause now I'm feeling so brand

Oh, I've never felt so brand new
Oh, I've never felt so brand new

I paid a price, worked and I wallowed
Burned all your letters just for fun
All of that time is easy to swallow
Now that I'm better

Oh, and somewhere in your room
I left my virtue and my favorite shoes
I don't want 'em back, never give 'em back to me
You can walk a mile in 'em, tell me how they feel on you
I'll be busy being so brand new

Oh, I've never felt so brand new
Oh, I've never felt so brand new

So brand new
Never felt so brand new
Never felt so brand new

So brand new
So brand new, oh (so brand new)
No, I've never felt so brand new

New, new, new (so brand new)
Oh, I've never felt so brand new, new, new (so brand new)
Oh, I've never felt so brand new

So brand new
I've never felt so brand new 

I don't know if you're listening or if you wanted to hear from me
I don't feel like you're supposed to when somebody sets you free
I'm not good at pretending that I'm happy to be alone
Part of me is a question, can't answer it on my own
'Cause I lost part of me when I lost all of you, now I'm lost

I don't wanna come crawling, crawling
But I catch myself falling, falling
I could try to stop calling, calling just to show myself
Did you keep my sweater, sweater
Did you read my letter, letter?
Do you know me better, better than I know myself?
Do you know me better, better than I know myself?

I don't feel like we're done here
You got a lock on the things I want
I'm a lost, lonely one here who's addicted to holding on
I don't have you to kiss now and I'm putting myself to sleep
But it's me that I miss now, there's a me that I didn't keep

I don't wanna come crawling, crawling
But I catch myself falling, falling
I could try to stop calling, calling just to show myself
Did you keep my sweater, sweater
Did you read my letter, letter?
Do you know me better, better than I know myself?
Do you know me better, better than I know myself?
Than I know myself?

'Cause I lost part of me when I lost all of you, now I'm lost

I don't wanna come crawling, crawling
But I catch myself falling, falling
I could try to stop calling, calling just to show myself
Did you keep my sweater, sweater
Did you read my letter, letter?
Do you know me better, better than I know myself?
Do you know me better, better than I know myself?
Than I know myself?

I don't wanna wait any longer for the feeling of getting stronger
Maybe that's why I wrote a song for you
'Cause you know me better, better than I know myself 

Darling, you might think it's too soon
But I can't get you out of my head now
Picturing myself in your room
And I wanna be with you 'til I'm dead now

I want your friends to be my friends
I'll make you breakfast in your bed
I want it all with you
And if I'm coming on too strong
It's 'cause I've waited far too long
For someone just like you

I want a key to your house
I wanna pick up your clothes
I wanna clean up your mess
I wanna know where you hide things
Wanna be in your photos
Wanna share your address
I know, I know it's too soon, too fast
But this could last
I wanna share your address
I know, I know it, it feels like love
So let's shack up
I wanna share your address

I just wanna stare at your face
Then spend quality time with your mother
We can over-drink at your favorite place
And we can waste the whole next day to recover

I wanna watch you while you sleep
I know I might sound like a creep
But I can't help myself
And it's so easy to forget
That we've barely even met
But I want no one else (I want no one else)

I want a key to your house
I wanna pick up your clothes
I wanna clean up your mess
I wanna know where you hide things
Wanna be in your photos
Wanna share your address
I know, I know it's too soon, too fast
But this could last
I wanna share your address
I know, I know it, it feels like love
So let's shack up
I wanna share your address

I wanna be your emergency contact
You can put me down
'Cause you know I know you best (I know you best)
It doesn't matter where I go
Without you, I'll never be home
I wanna share your address
I wanna be your emergency contact
You can put me down
'Cause you know I know you best (I know you best)
It doesn't matter where I go
Without you, I'll never be home
I wanna share your address

I want a key to your house
I wanna pick up your clothes
I wanna clean up your mess
I wanna know where you hide things
Wanna be in your photos
Wanna share your address
I know, I know it's too soon, too fast
But this could last
I wanna share your address
I know, I know it, it feels like love
So let's shack up
I wanna share your address

You put all your faith in my dreams
You gave me the world that I wanted
What did I do to deserve you?
I follow your steps with my feet
I walk on the road that you started
I need you to know that I heard you, every word

I've waited way too long to say
Everything you mean to me

In case you don't live forever, let me tell you now
I love you more than you'll ever wrap your head around
In case you don't live forever, let me tell you the truth
I'm everything that I am because of you

I, I've carried this song in my mind
Listen, it's echoing in me
But I haven't helped you to hear it
We, we've only got so much time
I'm pretty sure it would kill me
If you didn't know the pieces of me are pieces of you

I've waited way too long to say
Everything you mean to me

In case you don't live forever, let me tell you now
I love you more than you'll ever wrap your head around
In case you don't live forever, let me tell you the truth
I'm everything that I am because of you

I have a hero whenever I need one
I just look up to you and I see one
I'm a man 'cause you taught me to be one

In case you don't live forever, let me tell you now
I love you more than you'll ever wrap your head around
In case you don't live forever, let me tell you the truth
I'm everything that I am

Whoa... whoa...
In case you don't live forever, let me tell you the truth
As long as I'm here as I am, so are you

I was walking down 57th street towards Park
With the same old song in my same old heart
Making plans I'm gonna do when I get older
Passed a gray-haired man and I found his eyes
It's like he knew my thoughts and he read my mind
Saying life is gonna find you when it's supposed to
Felt my feet stop short and I turned my head
Tried to lean into every word he said, then he said

When you are younger, you'll wish you're older
Then when you're older, you'll wish for time to turn around
Don't let your wonder turn into closure
When you get older, when you get older

Oh... oh... oh... oh...
Oh... oh... oh...

Have I killed my thoughts right before their prime?
Have I bit my tongue one too many times
Have I said it all the way I really meant to?
If I wait 'til my tomorrow comes
Is the waiting all I've ever done?
And will I get to, get to know myself in the place I am
Get to fall in love with another man and understand

When you are younger, you'll wish you're older
Then when you're older, you'll wish for time to turn around
Don't let your wonder turn into closure
When you get older, when you get older

Oh... oh... oh... oh...
Oh... oh... oh...

When you are younger, you'll wish you're older
When you get older, you'll wish for time to turn around
Don't let your wonder turn into closure
When you get older, when you get older

They met at school that's how it goes
Some drinks and then a rose
Then plans to meet again
He wrote her poems songs and prose
She knew that he'd propose
She only wondered when

One night before they went to bed
He kneeled on both knees
And this is what he said

"I may not be wise
And I won't save the day
But look in my eyes
And know I'll always stay
And I won't run away
I won't run away"

Some years went by they had a child
He was funny strange and mild
Their love for him ran deep
Some nights his dreams would drive him wild
So into bed she piled
To help him fall asleep

One night he couldn't get to bed
So she kneeled on both knees
And this is what she said

"I may not be wise
And I won't save the day
But look in my eyes
And know I'll always stay
And I won't run away
I won't run away"

You say it's safer on your own
You'd rather sleep alone
Then grow to need me there
But I hope now you can see
What my mom and dad showed me
I'm not going anywhere

I love you more and more each day
To love is not to leave
So hear me when I say

"I may not be wise
And I won't save the day
But look in my eyes
And know I'll always stay
And I won't run away
I won't run away" 

I've learned to slam on the brake
Before I even turn the key
Before I make the mistake
Before I lead with the worst of me

Give them no reason to stare
No slipping up if you slip away
So I got nothing to share
No, I got nothing to say

Step out, step out of the sun
If you keep getting burned
Step out, step out of the sun
Because you've learned, because you've learned

On the outside, always looking in
Will I ever be more than I've always been?
'Cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass
I'm waving through a window
I try to speak, but nobody can hear
So I wait around for an answer to appear
While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass
I'm waving through a window, oh
Can anybody see, is anybody waving back at me?

We start with stars in our eyes
We start believing that we belong
But every sun doesn't rise
And no one tells you where you went wrong

Step out, step out of the sun
If you keep getting burned
Step out, step out of the sun
Because you've learned, because you've learned

On the outside, always looking in
Will I ever be more than I've always been?
'Cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass
Waving through a window
I try to speak, but nobody can hear
So I wait around for an answer to appear
While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass
Waving through a window, oh
Can anybody see, is anybody waving?

When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?
When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?
When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?
When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?
Did I even make a sound?
Did I even make a sound?
It's like I never made a sound
Will I ever make a sound?

On the outside, always looking in
Will I ever be more than I've always been?
'Cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass
Waving through a window
I try to speak, but nobody can hear
So I wait around for an answer to appear
While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass
Waving through a window, oh
Can anybody see, is anybody waving back at me?

Is anybody waving?

End of May or early June
This picture-perfect afternoon we shared
Drive the winding country road
Grab a scoop at À La Mode
And then we're there

An open field that's framed with trees
We pick a spot and shoot the breeze
Like buddies do
Quoting songs by our favorite bands
Telling jokes no one understands
Except us two
And we talk and take in the view

All we see is sky for forever
We let the world pass by for forever
Feels like we could go on for forever this way
Two friends on a perfect day

We walk a while and talk about
The things we'll do when we get out of school
Bike the Appalachian trail or
Write a book or learn to sail
Wouldn't that be cool?

There's nothing that we can't discuss
Like girls we wish would notice us but never do
He looks around and says to me
"There's nowhere else I'd rather be"
And I say, "Me too"

And we talk and take in the view
We just talk and take in the view

All we see is sky for forever
We let the world pass by for forever
Feels like we could go on for forever this way, this way

All we see is light for forever
'Cause the sun shines bright for forever
Like we'll be alright for forever this way
Two friends on a perfect day

And there he goes
Racing toward the tallest tree
From far across the yellow field I hear him calling, "Follow me" There we go
Wondering how the world might look from up so high

One foot after the other
One branch then to another
I climb higher and higher
I climb 'til the entire
Sun shines on my face

And I suddenly feel the branch give way
I'm on the ground
My arm goes numb
I look around
And I see him come to get me
He's come to get me
And everything's okay

All we see is sky for forever
We let the world pass by for forever
Buddy, you and I for forever this way, this way

All we see is light
'Cause the sun burns bright
We could be alright for forever this way
Two friends
True friends
On a perfect day 

I never meant to make it such a mess
I never thought that it would go this far
So I just stand here sorry
Searching for something to say
Something to say
Words fail, words fail
There's nothing I can say

I guess I thought I could be part of this
I never had this kind of thing before
I never had that perfect girl
Who somehow could see the good part of me

I never had the dad who stuck it out
No corny jokes or baseball gloves
No mom who just was there
'Cause mom was all that she had to be

That's not a worthy explanation
I know there is none
Nothing can make sense of all these things I've done

Words fail, words fail
There's nothing I can say
Except sometimes, you see everything you wanted
And sometimes, you see everything you wish you had
And it's right there, right there, right there
In front of you
And you want to believe it's true
So you... make it true
And you think maybe everybody wants it
And needs it... a little bit... too

This was just a sad invention
It wasn't real, I know
But we were happy
I guess I couldn't let that go
I guess I couldn't give that up
I guess I wanted to believe
'Cause if I just believe
Then I don't have to see what's really there

No, I'd rather pretend I'm something better than
These broken parts
Pretend I'm something other than
This mess that I am
'Cause then I don't have to look at it
And no one gets to look at it
No, no one can really see

'Cause I've learned to slam on the brake
Before I even turn the key
Before I make the mistake
Before I lead with the worst of me
I never let them see the worst of me

'Cause what if everyone saw?
What if everyone knew?
Would they like what they saw?
Or would they hate it too?
Will I just keep on running away from what's true?

All I ever do is run
So how do I step in
Step into the sun?
Step into the sun 

Wait, I think it's time
Your fire's lit and so is mine
Go turn out the light
Don't be afraid, tonight's the night

And I won't, I won't try to change you
But I will, I will if I want to
Yeah, it always brings me down
When you're not around
I still need you

Oh, You do something for me baby
I cannot control it, baby
You do something for me
Oh, You do something crazy to me
I cannot control it, baby
You do something for me

And I feel so down
When you're not around

Boy, we're almost there
I'll lay your clothes over my chair
Pull the shades down low
We're both ready so lose control

And I won't, I won't try to tame you
But I will, I will if you want to
Yeah it always brings me down
When you're not around
I still need you

Oh, You do something for me baby
I cannot control it, baby
You do something for me
Oh, You do something crazy to me
I cannot control it, baby
You do something for me

And I feel so down
When you're not around

And I won't, I won't try to tame you
But I will, I will if you want to
Yeah it always brings me down
When you're not around
I still need you

Oh, You do something for me baby
I cannot control it lately
You do something for me
Oh, You do something for me baby
I cannot control it lately
You do something for me

Oh, You do something crazy to me
I cannot control it, baby
You always bring me down 

It's funny how things, they change
The clouds they part, rearrange for me
Faces of strangers and I have no familiars to help me see
Where is home, I want you to know

That I wish you were here
I wish you were here

Sometimes I wonder if god hides out in cities to set us free
'cause yeah, this room is crowded
But I am so alone in it, help me please
Where is home, I want you to know

That I wish you were here
I wish you were here

And I will be strong, I won't give in
I won't deny you, I know where we've been
I'm so much more than all of my fears
Than all of these tears, my tears yeah

I never ever thought I'd live away
From everyone I love and say goodbye
Now I'm the princess of a downtown train
Where everybody here, they know my game
But when I walk down the street I hear them say
"there she goes, that crazy girl
She thinks she's something in this world"

So I'mma close my ears and dream
'cause life is never really what it seems
In every mystery, there's a truth
You know I'm tellin', I'm tellin' you...

No matter lightning or thunder,
Buckets of rainwater
You can't flood this town

In a world unknown
You've gotta hold your own
You can't stop me
You're never ever gonna stop me now

On every street there is a memory,
A time and place where we can never be again
Street lights glow red, green, and yellow too
Do you let signs tell you what to do?
Yeah, when you say stop,
Be sure that I'll say go
To the stars in the land

Fire can't burn these hands
But I just close my eyes and dream
You cant deny me my astronomy

In every mystery, there's a truth
You know I'm tellin', I'm tellin' you...oh..

No matter lightning or thunder,
Buckets of rainwater
You can't flood this town

In a world unknown
You've gotta hold your own
And you can't stop me
You're never ever ever gonna stop me now

Go ahead and don't believe
'cause everyone needs a way to breathe
And love and dream and you can't stop me
No you can't stop me

No matter lightning or thunder,
Buckets of rainwater
You can't flood this town

In a world unknown
You've gotta hold your own
And you can't stop me
You're never ever ever gonna stop

No matter lightning or thunder,
Buckets of rainwater
You can't flood this town

In a world unknown
You've gotta hold your own 

I think, I love you.
You got ripped jeans.
I'm only nineteen.
What do you wanna do?
You got your cigarette.
I got my headset.
We're two of a kind,
You're spades & I'm diamonds,
And you know that you.

Yeah, you can see clearly, that I am the one you want.
But I must admit, that, I'm everything you're not.

Yeah, I am red, you are blue.
I'm old-school & you're so new.
But I guess, I could forgive you, tonight.
When you're cool,
I like to burn.
I cut lines, so, wait your turn.
But I guess, I could forgive you, tonight.
Tonight, tonight, tonight.

Don't shoot.
My heart is on mute.
Our physical dreams, are only skin deep,
How do you wanna groove?
Bang, bang.
You hear my gun ring, oh.
Yeah.
Your mind, your deck, you're hidden.
I am all up inside your head.

Yeah, you can see clearly, that I am the one you want.
But I must admit, that, I'm everything you're not.

Yeah, I am red, you are blue.
I'm old-school & you're so new.
But I guess, I could forgive you, tonight.
When you're cool,
I like to burn.
I cut lines, so, wait your turn.
But I guess, I could forgive you, tonight.
Tonight, tonight, tonight.

You won't forget me, when I'm gone.
This feels so good, it can't be wrong.
I'd recommend, a one-night stand.
I know, we're just friends, but
You're my kind of man.
Just for tonight.
Just for tonight.
Just for tonight.

Even though, I'm red, you are blue.
I'm old-school & you're so new.
I know, we could be great for tonight.
When you're cool,
I'll make it burn.
You'll never have to wait your turn.
Yeah, I guess, I could forgive you, tonight.
Tonight, tonight.

Yeah, I am red, you are blue.
I'm old-school & you're so new.
But I guess, I could forgive you, tonight.
When you're cool,
I like to burn.
I cut lines, so, wait your turn.
But I guess, I could forgive you, tonight.

Damn I love the Jag, the jet and the mansion
Oh yea
And I enjoy the gifts and trips to the islands
Oh yea

It's good to live expensive you know it but
My knees get weak, intensive

When you give me k-kisses
That's money honey
When I'm your lover and your mistress
That's money honey
When you touch me it's so delicious
That's money honey
Baby when you tear me to pieces
That's money honey

That's money honey

Damn I'd love a boat by the beach on the west coast
Oh yea
And I'd enjoy some fine champagne while my girls toast
Oh yea

Its good to live expensive you know it but
My knees get weak, intensive


You know I appreciate the finer things
But it's not what makes me happiest baby
Your tender loving's more than I can handle
Never burn out this candle baby, baby


You've gotta a lot of lot of nerve
Coming here when I'm still with him
And I can't have you, it isn't fair
Born march of '86, my birthday's coming
And if I had one wish
Yeah, you'd be it

When you're 'round
I lose myself inside your mouth
You've got brown eyes
Like no one else
Baby make it to me

Again and again
Again, again, again, again
Never stop again and again
Never stop, oh

He never really saw me
Or waited when we were hooking up
Yeah he'd a never last
Last week when I was sad
You said that you knew
My eyes change from kinda green

When you're 'round
I lose myself inside your mouth
You've got brown eyes
Like no one else
Baby make it to me

Again and again
Again, again, again, again
Never stop again and again
Again, again, a-a-again, again
Never stop

They tell me if I leave him
Baby would you be there
'cause maybe you could

Your love is nothing I can't fight
Can't sleep with the man who dims my shine

I'm in the bedroom with tissues and when
I know you're outside banging then I won't let you in
'Cause it's a hard life
With love in the world
And I'm a hard girl
Loving me is like chewing on pearls

You've got me wondering why I
I like it rough I
I like it rough I
I like it rough

You've got me wondering why I
I like it rough I
I like it rough I
I like it rough

Won't go without my fix tonight
It's a little too rough
Prom girl wipes her tears with silver lines
And she can't get enough

I'm in the bedroom with tissues and when
I know you're outside banging then I won't let you in
'Cause it's a hard life
With love in the world
And I'm a hard girl
Loving me is like straightening curls

You've got me wondering why I
I like it rough I
I like it rough I
I like it rough

You've got me wondering why I
I like it rough I
I like it rough I
I like it rough

I'm shiny and I know it
Don't know why you wanna blow it
Need a man who likes it rough
Likes it rough, likes it rough

I'm shiny and I know it
Don't know why you wanna blow it
Need a man who likes it rough
Likes it rough, likes it rough

I'm shiny and I know it
Don't know why you wanna blow it
Need a man who likes it rough
Likes it rough, likes it rough

I'm shiny and I know it
Don't know why you wanna blow it
Need a man who likes it rough
Likes it rough, likes it rough

Is it 'cause you don't mean it
Or because I don't feel it
Unless it's rough

Is it because you don't mean it
Or because I don't feel it
Yes it's rough

Silicon, saline, poison inject me
Baby, I'm a free bitch
I'm a free bitch

Some girls won't dance to the beat of the track
She won't walk away, but she won't look back
She looks good, but her boyfriend says she's a mess
She's a mess
She's a mess
Now the girl is stressed
She's a mess
She's a mess
She's a mess
She's a mess

(Tell 'em, girls)

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin' she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark
Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin' she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, loves to dance in the dark

(Tell 'em, girls)

Run, run. Her kiss is a vampire grin
The moon lights her way while she's howlin' at him
She looks good, but her boyfriend says she's a tramp
She's a tramp
She's a vamp
But she still does her dance
She's a tramp
She's a vamp
But she still kills the dance

(Tell 'em, girls)

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin' she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark
Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin' she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, loves to dance in the dark

In the dark
She loves to dance in the dark
In the dark
She loves, she loves to dance in the dark

Marilyn
Judy
Sylvia
Tell 'em how you feel girls!

Work your blonde JonBenét Ramsey
We'll haunt like Liberace
Find your freedom in the music
Find your Jesus
Find your Kubrick
You will never fall apart
Diana, you're still in our hearts
Never let you fall apart
Together we'll dance in the dark

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin' she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark
Baby
Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin' she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, loves to dance in the dark

In the dark 

I can't believe what you said to me
Last night we were alone
You threw your hands up
Baby you gave up, you gave up

I can't believe how you looked at me
With your James Dean glossy eyes
In your tight jeans with your long hair
And your cigarette stained lies

Could we fix you if you broke?
And is your punch line just a joke?

I'll never talk again
Oh boy you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless

And I'll never love again,
Oh boy you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless

I can't believe how you slurred at me
With your half wired broken jaw
You popped my heart seams
On my bubble dreams, bubble dreams

I can't believe how you looked at me
With your Johnnie Walker eyes
He's gonna get you and after he's through
There's gonna be no love left to rye

And I know that it's complicated
But I'm a loser in love
So baby raise a glass to mend
All the broken hearts
Of all my wrecked up friends

I'll never talk again
Oh boy you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless

And I'll never love again,
Oh friend you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless

How?
Haaaa-oooo-wow?
H-ooow?
Wow

Haaaa-oooo-wow?
H-ooow?
Wow

And after all the drinks and bars that we've been to
Would you give it all up?
Could I give it all up for you?

And after all the boys and the girls that we've been through
Would you give it all up?
Could you give it all up?

If I promise boy to you
That I'll never talk again
And I'll never love again
I'll never write a song
Won't even sing along

I'll never love again
So speechless
You left me speechless, so speechless
Why you so speechless, so speechless?

Will you ever talk again?
Oh boy, why you so speechless?
You've left me speechless, so speechless

Some men may follow me
But you choose "death and company"


I love that lavender blonde
The way she moves
The way she walks
I touch myself can't get enough
And in the silence of the night
Through all the tears
And all the lies
I touch myself and it's alright

Just give in
Don't give up baby
Open up your heart and your mind to me

Just know when
That glass is empty
That the world is gonna bend

Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine
Stars in our eyes 'cuz we're having a good time

So happy I could die
Be your best friend
Yeah I'll love you forever
Up in the clouds
We'll be higher than ever

I'm gonna marry the night
I won't give up on my life
I'm a warrior queen
Live passionately tonight

I'm gonna marry the dark
Gonna make love to the stark
I'm a soldier to my own emptiness
I am a winner

I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night

I'm gonna marry the night
I'm not gonna cry anymore
I'm gonna marry the night
Leave nothing on these streets to explore

I'm gonna lace up my boots
Throw on some leather and cruise
Down the streets that I love
In my fishnet gloves
I'm a sinner

Then I'll go down to the bar
But I won't cry anymore
I'll hold my whiskey up high
Kiss the bartender twice
I'm a loser

I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night

I'm gonna marry the night
I'm not gonna cry anymore
I'm gonna marry the night
Leave nothing on these streets to explore

M-m-m-marry m-m-m-marry m-m-m-marry the night
Oh m-m-marry m-m-m-marry m-m-m-marry the night

Nothing's too cool
To take me from you
New York is not just a tan that you'll never lose
Love is the new denim or black
Skeleton guns are wedding bells in the attic
Get Ginger ready climb El Camino front
Won't poke holes in the seats with my heels
'Cause that's where we make love

Come on and run
Turn the car on and run

I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna burn a hole in the road
I'm gonna marry the night
Leave nothin' on these streets to explore

We can be strong, we can be strong
Out on this lonely road, on the road to love
We can be strong, we can be strong
Follow that unicorn on the road to love

Run, run with the top down baby, she flies
Run, run with the fury of the saint in her eyes
Run, run hide your cha-cha, baby she goes
With blonde hair and a gun smoking under her toes

We can be strong, we can be strong
Out on this lonely road, on the road to love
We can be strong, we can be strong
Follow that unicorn on the road to love

I'm on the road, I'm on the road to love

She's just an American riding a dream
And she's got rainbow syrup in her heart that she bleeds
They don't care if your papers or your love is the law
She's a free soul burning roads with the flag in her bra

Ride, ride, pony, ride, ride
Ride, ride, pony, tonight

We can be strong, we can be strong
Out on this lonely road, on the road to love
We can be strong, we can be strong
Follow that unicorn on the road to love

I'm on the road, I'm on the road to love
I'm on the road, I'm on the road to love

Get your hot rods ready to rumble 'cuz we're gonna fall in love tonight
Get your hot rods ready to rumble 'cuz we're gonna drink until we die
Get your hot rods ready to rumble 'cuz we're gonna fall in love tonight
Get your hot rods ready to rumble 'cuz we're gonna drink until we die 

My body is sanctuary
My blood is pure
My body is sanctuary
My blood is pure

Follow me
Don’t be such a holy fool
Follow me
I need something more from you

It’s not about sex or champagne
You holy fool

If you want me
Meet me at Electric Chapel
If you want me
Meet me at Electric Chapel
If you wanna steal my heart away
Meet me, meet me baby in a safe place
Come on meet me
In Electric Chapel

Confess to me where you have been
Next to the bar
Pray for your sins
Right under the glass disco ball


There ain't no reason you and me should be alone
And I got a reason that you're who should take me home tonight (Tonight)
I need a man that thinks it's right when it's so wrong
Right on the limits where we know we both belong tonight

It's hard to feel the rush, to brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love

I grew up in New York City,
Since I was born on Broadway, baby!
Moved downtown when I was just nineteen,
To start a new life on the New York scene.

There's no way I could be stopped,
Was taking my best shot,
I had a better plan.
There's no way I could be stopped,
Was coming for your spot.
I'm in a battle, man.

Dancing in my revelation,
Underground pop civilization.
Concrete poetry to feed my mind,
Old symbolism was left behind.

There's no way I could be stopped,
Was taking my best shot,
I had a better plan,
There's no way I could be stopped,
Was coming for your spot.
I'm in a battle, man.

I never was the kind of girl,
That's naturally sure when it comes to love, oh no!
I was insecure, insecure.

But when it comes to you and me,
I can't deny this feeling inside, oh no!
I never felt like this before, this before.

I'm gonna be the one that he loves,
I was made for loving him.
The fashion of his love.

You know that I'd never cheat on a man.
'Cause I'm not like that.
I'm physically crafted to be
As fitting as McQueen.

But when it comes to clothing, I'm bad.
I'm fashionably just designed to be rad.
Oh and he's no accessory to me.

No, I just can't seem to forget you
No I can't for just as long as I met you.
You're my babe, right through.

They say I need a strong man, not just a friend
But baby, my search is done.
No longer reason to pry or to justify,
How I feel for you, my love.

Tonight I'm gonna show
Them what I'm made of, oh!
The killer queen inside me's
Coming to say "Hello!"

Tonight I will return
The fame and riches earned
With you I'd watch them all be burnt

Whenever I start feeling strong, I'm called a bitch in the night
But I don't need these 14-carat guns to win
I am a woman, I insist it's my life

The queen that's inside of me
This is my chance to release it
Be brave for you you'll see

The queen you need me to be
This is my chance to be the dance
I've dreamed it's happening
I can be the queen

I am wind and hurricane
The stormy sky and rain
When you run dry I'll flood your pain

In between the moments of
The lady I've become
A voice beats through the noise like drums 

Starry night come inside me like never before
Don't forget me when I come crying to heaven's door
I will fly on a challenger across the sky
Like a phoenix so you can remind them of the dream I bore

I was walking along, minding my business,
When out of the orange colored sky,
Flash, bam, alacazam, wonderful you came by.

I was humming a tune, drinking in sunshine,
When out of that orange colored view
Wham, bam, alacazam, I got a look at you.

Ohhh,
One look and I yelled timber
Watch out for flying glass.
Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out
I went into a spin and I started to shout
I've been hit, this is it, this is it.

I was walking along minding my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
Flash, bam, alacazam,
Out of the orange colored sky.

Ohhh,
One look and I yelled timber
Watch out for flying glass.
Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out
I went into a spin and I started to shout
I've been hit, this is it, this is it.

I was walking along minding my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
Wam, bam, alacazam,
Out of the orange colored, purple striped, pretty green polka dot skyyy
Flash, bam, alacazaaam,
Had gooonnne, bye.
Good bye. 

It's been a long time since I came around
Been a long time but I'm back in town
This time I'm not leaving without you
You taste like whiskey when you kiss me, oh
I'd give anything again to be your baby doll
This time I'm not leaving without you

He said, "Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time and you said to me

'There's somethin', somethin' about this place
Somethin' 'bout New York nights and my lipstick on your face
Somethin', somethin' about my cool American guy
Yeah something about, baby, you and I.'"

America, America, I love you

You and I
You, you, you and I
You, you and I
You, you and I, I, I

You and I
You, you, you and I
America, I would rather die without you and I, I, I

We got a whole lot of money but we still pay rent
'Cause you can't buy a house in heaven
There's only three men that I'm 'a serve my whole life
It's my daddy and America, and Jesus Christ
Happy Thanksgiving

There's somethin', somethin' about the chase six whole years
So put your drink up
Put your drink up for America
America, I love you

You and I
You, you and I
I would rather die without you and I 

I killed my former and
Left her in the trunk on highway 10
Put the knife under the hood.
If you find it, send it straight to Hollywood

I'm not a wandering slave, I am a woman of choice
My veil is protection for the gorgeousness of my face
You ought to pity me cause there's always one man to love
But in the bedroom the size of him's more than enough

Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura, behind the aura?
Do you wanna touch me, cosmic lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura
Behind the aura, behind the aura, behind the aura?

Enigma popstar is fun, she wear burqa for fashion
It's not a statement as much as just a move of passion
I may not walk on your street or shoot a gun on your soil
I hear you screaming, is it because of pleasure or toil?

When you touch me I die
Just a little inside
I wonder if this could be love
This could be love
'Cause you’re out of this world
Galaxy, space and time
I wonder if this could be love

I feel good, I walk alone
But then I trip over myself and I fall
I, I stand up, and then I'm okay
But then you print some shit
That makes me wanna scream

You can't have my heart
And you won't use my mind but

Do what you want with my body
You can't stop my voice cause
You don't own my life but

Sometimes I'm scared I suppose
If you ever let me go
I would fall apart
If you break my heart
So just take my body
And don't stop the party


Come to me
In all your glamour and cruelty
Just do that thing that you do
And I'll undress you

Keep it tight
Sometimes the simplest move is right
The melody that you choose
Can rescue you

A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings

Come to me
With all your subtext and fantasy
Just do that thing that you do
In a perverse hue

Lovers' kites
Are flown on beaches for public sight
The color palette you choose
Can profit you

I wanna dress you up in silk, Taffeta
Tailor these clothes to fit your guilt, what's your size?
This purse can hold my black card and tiara
Versace promises I will, Dolce Vita

What do you wanna wear this spring?
What do you think is the new thing?
What do you wanna wear this season?

Walk down the runway, but don't puke, It's okay
You just had a salad today, Boulangerie
Just ask your gay friends their advice, before you
Get a spray tan on Holiday, in Taipei

Step into the room
Like it's a catwalk
Fashion!
Singing to the tune
Just to keep them talking
Fashion!
Walk into the light
Display your diamonds and pearls in mine
Fashion!
Married to the night
I own the world, we own the world

Be a slave to the blonde or the culture of the popular
You better than, you better than
My darkest sin
Russian hookers, and cheap gin
I think that I could be fine
If I could be Mary Jane Holland tonight
I think we'd have a good time
If you'd meet me Mary Jane in Holland tonight

Corks off, it's on
The party's just begun
I promise this
Drink is my last one
I know I fucked up again
'Cause I lost my only friend
God forgive my sins

Don't leave me, I
Oh, I'd hate myself until I die
My heart would break without you
Might not awake without you
Been hurting low from living high for so long
I'm sorry, and I love you
Sing with me, "Bell Bottom Blue"
I'll keep on searching for an answer 'cause I need you more than dope

Toast one last puff
And two last regrets
Three spirits and
Twelve lonely steps
Up heaven's stairway to gold
Mine myself like coal
A mountain of his soul

Each day, I cry
Oh, I feel so low from living high

Sometimes a story has no end
Sometimes I think that we could just be friends
"'Cause I'm a wandering man, " he said to me.

And what about our future plans?
Does this thing we have even make sense?
When I got the whole world in front of me

So I said, "I don't wanna be alone forever.
But I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever
But I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever
But I can be tonight, tonight."

So I just packed my baggage and
Said goodbye to family and friends
And took the road to nowhere on my own

Like Dorothy on a yellow brick
Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick
'Cause I left everyone I love at home

And I don't wanna be alone forever
But I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever
But I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever
But I can be tonight, tonight


And then he asked me,
He said, "Baby, why do we love each other?"
I said, "Honey, it's simple.
It's the way that you love and treat your mother."

Thought that I would be alone forever
But I won't be tonight
I'm a man without a home
But I think with you I can spend my life
And you'll be my little gypsy princess
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset
Bust the rearview and fire up the jets
'Cause it's you and me
Baby, for life


Young, wild, American
Lookin' to be somethin'
Out of school go-go'n
For a hundred or two
Some asshole broke me in
Wrecked all my innocence
I'll just keep go-go'n
And this dance is on you

One, five, ten, lay a million on me
Before the end of this song

Young, wild, American
C'mon baby, do you have a girlfriend?
Rain on me a million
I'm not flawless, but I got a diamond heart

Oh, I
I might not be flawless, but you know
I got a diamond heart
Oh, I
I might not be flawless, but you know
I got a diamond heart

Young, wild, American
Head full of Jameson
Girl's playin' bad 'cause it doesn't pay to be good
A cruel king made me tough
Daddy's girl's never good enough
I'll just keep go-go'n
'Cause this dance is on you

One, five, ten, lay a million on me
Before the end of this song

Young, wild, American
C'mon baby, do you have a girlfriend?
Rain on me a million
I'm not flawless, but I got a diamond heart

Oh, I
I might not be flawless, but you know
I got a diamond heart
Oh, I
I might not be flawless, but you know
I got a diamond heart

Good thing I know what I'm worth
Want a good thing, put the money down first
Better get a good look baby
'Cause soon I'm breaking out of here

Young, wild, American
C'mon baby, do you have a girlfriend?
Rain on me a million
I'm not flawless, but I got a diamond heart

Oh, I
I might not be flawless, but you know
I got a diamond heart
Oh, I
I might not be flawless, but you know
I got a diamond heart

Diamond heart 

Take my hand, stay Joanne
Heaven's not
Ready for you
Every part
Of my aching heart
Needs you more
Than the angels do

Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'?
Goin', girl?
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'?
Goin', girl?

If you could
I know that you'd stay
We both know
Things don't work that way
I promised I
Wouldn't say goodbye
So I grin
And my voice gets thin

Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'?
Goin', girl?
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'?
Goin', girl?

Honestly, I know where you're goin'
And baby, you're just movin' on
And I'll still love you even if I can't
See you anymore
Can't wait to see you soar

Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'?
Goin', girl?
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'?
Goin', girl? 

Tap down those boots while I beat around
Let's funk downtown
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Funk me downtown

I lay around, touch myself to pass the time
I feel down, I wish you were mine
I close my eyes
Take a breath and I picture us in a place
I can't recognize

In the fire I call your name out (call your name out, call your name out)
Up all night tryin' to rub the pain out

I'm singin'
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
I'm singin' dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely

Tap down those boots while I beat around
Let's funk downtown
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Funk me downtown

I fool myself
Swirl around as if I'm someone else
Your hands are mine
I do a trick
Pretend that I am you until it clicks
I come alive
Come alive

In the fire I call your name out (call your name out, call your name out)
Up all night tryin' to rub the pain out (rub the pain out)

I'm singin'
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
I'm singin' dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely

Tap down those boots while I beat around
Let's funk downtown
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Funk me downtown
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Let's funk downtown
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Funk me downtown

Hurts inside, but not this time
All the things that are on my mind
Vanish as I touch myself
Call out loud for you
Oh, can you hear me singin'?

Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
I'm singin'
Dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely

Tap down those boots while I beat around
Let's funk downtown
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Funk me downtown
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Let's funk downtown
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Funk me downtown


Tryin' to keep control
Pressure's takin' its toll
Stuck in the middle zone
I just want you alone
My guessing game is strong
Way too real to be wrong
Caught up in your show
Yeah, at least now I know

It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)

Oh
You were a perfect illusion

I don't need eyes to see
I felt you touchin' me
High like amphetamine
Maybe you're just a dream
That's what it means to crush
Now that I'm wakin' up
I still feel the blow
But at least now I know

It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)

Where are you?
'Cause I can't see (it was a perfect illusion)
But I feel you watchin' me
Dilated, falling free
In a modern ecstasy

Where are you?
'Cause I can't see (it was a perfect illusion)
But I feel you watchin' me
But I feel you watchin' me (illusion)
But I feel you watchin' me (mistaken for love)

Where were you?
'Cause I can't see
But I feel you watchin' me (mistaken for love)
Dilated, falling free
In a modern ecstasy (mistaken for love)
In a modern ecstasy
In a modern ecstasy

I'm over the show
Yeah, at least now I know

It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)

Oh
You were a perfect illusion
Oh
It was a perfect illusion

It was a perfect illusion
Somewhere in all the confusion
It was a perfect illusion, illusion, illusion

It was a perfect illusion
Somewhere in all the confusion
You were so perfect

Everybody's got to love each other
Stop throwin' stones at your sisters and your brothers
Man, it wasn't that long ago we were all living in the jungle
So why do we gotta put each other down
When there's more than enough love to g-g-go around?

Come to mama
Tell me who hurt ya
There's gonna be no future
If we don't figure this out

Dude in a lab coat and a man of God
(Come onto mama, come on, mama)
Fought over prisms and a forty-day flood
(Come onto mama, come on, mama)
Well, I say rainbows did more than they've ever done
So why do we gotta fight over ideas?
We're talkin' the same old shit after all of these years

Come to mama
Tell me who hurt ya
There's gonna be no future
If we don't figure this out
Oh, come tomorrow
Who are you gonna follow?
There's gonna be no future
If we don't figure this out

Psychic guru catches minnows in the harbor
(Come onto mama, come on, mama)
Everyone tells him he should work a little harder
(Come onto mama, come on, mama)
(Hey, man, get to work, catch up)
They all tell you that freedom must be bought
But, baby, he's already caught them
So why do we gotta tell each other how to live?
The only prisons that exist are ones we put each other in

Come to mama
Tell me who hurt ya
There's gonna be no future
If we don't figure this out
Oh, come tomorrow
Who are you gonna follow?
There's gonna be no future
If we don't figure this out

Come to mama (Come onto me)
Come on mama
Come on mama
Come on mama

'Cause I wanna be there
I wanna be there for you
I wanna be there

Why do we gotta tell each other how to live?
The only prisons that exist are ones we put each other in
Why do we gotta tell each other how to live?
Look what that rainbow did 


I was 23
She was 35
I was spiraling out
And she was so alive
A Texas girl real strong
Taught me this drunk song
So when I start to bawl
She says, "let your teardrops fall"

On the Pinot, Pinot Grigio girls
Pour your heart out
Watch your blues turn gold
All the Pinot, Pinot Grigio girls
Keep it real cold
'Cause it's a fired up world
Oh, oh, make it all make sense
Oh, oh, does it all make sense?
Oh, oh, make it all make sense

Sisters never pack up
We always run back love
Seven years ago
I said you'd make it
Sonja was Joanne's friend
Tough girls on the mend
So when I'm feeling small
I toss that cork and call

On the Pinot, Pinot Grigio girls
Pour your heart out
Watch your blues turn gold
All the Pinot, Pinot Grigio girls
Keep it real cold
'Cause it's a fired up world
Oh, oh, make it all make sense
Oh, oh, make it all make sense
Oh, oh, does it all make sense?

So we'll turn on a bachelorette
Dye Ashley's hair red
And then we'll have our sixth
Spice girl in this bitch

On the Pinot, Pinot Grigio girls
Pour your heart out
Watch your blues turn gold
All the Pinot, Pinot Grigio girls
Keep it real cold
'Cause it's a fired up world

All the Pinot, Pinot Grigio girls
Gather 'round now
Watch your blues turn gold
All the Pinot, Pinot Grigio girls
Keep it real cold
'Cause it's a fired up world

Just another way to prove I love you
And it's hard today
I'll lay back in my chair and find a way
And when you say that thing that you say
That makes me mad
I'll turn away, I'll turn away, I'll turn away

And think of different ways to keep my spirits up
And choreograph hours with playful, joyous thoughts

We both know I could learn a thing or two
About relaxing, hey, I love you
And after all, it's just another day

Oh, I could use some two or three
Or other kind of ways to be
But today I won't be so hard on me
I'll walk alone down a different street
And smile at all the new strange I meet

And pick up unique style, I'll kick around today
And create simple thoughts, I'll laugh in humble ways

We both know I could learn a thing or two
About behaving, but I love you
And after all, it's just another day

Come on, Mark

Ladies and gentlemen, Brian Newman

We both know I could learn a thing or two
About behaving, but I love you
And after all, it's just another day

And after all
It's just another day 

[Verse 1]
I always thought it was you,
You always thought it was me.
We always thought we were it,
Seemed like a real perfect fit,
Those Brooklyn Nights set us free.

I always thought even though,
We were so young we could grow.
Up in the end it'd be us,
We'd take the F or the bus,
Where Brooklyn Nights set us free.

Its not that I don't wanna love you
Its not that I'm really over it, you know (you know)
Its just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be
Brooklyn Nights happy.

I miss our cheap chandalier
'Member when dad hung it there?
And we would watch Rocky IV,
The one where the Russian scored,
I loved Brigitte Nielsen's hair.

I'd call you my champion
Thought we had already won
And cracked open our last beer,
Falling asleep in our tears,
Those Brooklyn Nights set us free.

Its not that I don't wanna love you
Its not that I'm really over it, you know (you know)
Its just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be
Brooklyn Nights happy.

I found an old pair of
Keys in my purse that opened
The walkup we shared
How did they get there, jerk?
I wanna see you there
I wanna make it work.

I didn't brush my hair
And my lashes are falling
Off of seven years
Of our bad luck dating.
I want one last night there,
A Brooklyn Night affair.

Its not that I don't wanna love you
Its not that I'm really over it, you know (you know)
Its just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be
Brooklyn Nights happy.

Its not that I don't want to love you
Cause I really tried, and I
Just wanna hang with the old you
For just one Brooklyn Night adieu.

Have a drink with your former self
We both won't act like someone else
Maybe then we'd both tell the truth
For just one Brooklyn Night adieu
One look and I'm done,
One glance from your eyes,
And I'm captivated

The taste of your skin,
The warmth of your hungry lips
Has me so taken and I
Love the way you can make me dance
From miles away
When I'm with you, I'm so sedated,
I'm captivated by you

You're just like the wind 'cause
Everything moves away
When you're around it

The sun is just like the sound
Of your voice in the morning
When you light my world up and I
Love the way you can make me dance
From miles away
When I'm with you I'm never jaded,
I'm captivated

Oh, I'll never stop believing
In this crazy love we're leading
Oh, sugar,
Hold me closer,
Make me sweeter,
I need ya,
I love you

So, please, show me that smile,
Make me laugh for just a little while
Then breathe me one breath,
I only need one to fill the emptiness and I
Love the way you can make me dance
From miles away
It's been so long but now,
I've waited, and I'm captivated

We are a generation twisted, by a myth.
Confused & ludicrous.
Holding on to love.
Consumed, by all the pleasures, that are mixed.
Alive with all the lips we've kissed,
And losing all control.

We're gonna start a resistance.
And we want independence.
We're gonna give the world some of this.

Electric Kiss.
I'm gonna change the world, with my lips.
One voice, forever.
We'll live together.
In peace, love, solitude, & happiness.
Electric Kiss.

Fame is our felony,
We're so in love with it.
Some superstars & masochists,
Who don't know, where to go.
But the poets,
And the fighters of our time.
Put down their weapons, in their rhymes.
And they know, what they must do.

They're gonna start a resistance.
And they want independence.
They're gonna give the world some of this.

Electric Kiss.
I'm gonna change the world, with my lips.
One voice, forever.
We'll live together.
In peace, love, solitude, & happiness.

Electric Kiss.
I'm gonna change the world, with my lips.
Oh, one voice, forever.
We'll live together.
In peace, love, solitude, & happiness.
Electric Kiss.

Eyes 


I’ve got no friends
I’m my own queen
But I’m living on, living on the the radio
That’s my dream

Stone river eyes
And a lonely heart
If I’m living on the radio
They won’t tear me apart

10 steps and roses on the tree
10 steps and lonely nights
But you’ve still got me
On the road
Road paved in gold

Baby you must believe
Baby you must be free
Keep living on, living on the radio
That’s my dream

Baby you’ve gotta friend
And so many little monsters, yeah
Keep living on, living on the radio
That’s your dream

And when there’s nowhere to go
And your friends are gone
And you only got your daddy to call
It will be all right, honey
‘Cause your songs are on the radio

‘Cause the showbiz, all the caviar
The champagne and the sold out shows
But it will be all right honey
‘Cause your songs are on the radio 


I'm calling cause I need you,
You know I need you so desperately
You know how bad I can get,
And you know how good I can be.
I'm calling just to tell you,
Get here and I'll make it worth, your while
I can make you some good
Boy, and then I can make you smile

Cause I've got nothing on, but the radio
And I've got nothing on for tonight.
(Nothing) Nothing on but the radio,
And I'm tuned into your station tonight,
With me tonight.

You better get here soon
O-or you know what I will do
Got too much time on my hand
Wait till I get my hands on you

When you get here, boy, we can dance.
Our hands on the headboard, it's our defense.
I've turned the lights down low,
And I've got nothing on but the radio.

Got too much time on my hands.
Wait 'til I get my hands on you.

Last time, I thought we had this talk
Boy, you were getting ready to leave
I thought that baby you were done
Cause for a while, you could barely look at me

This time, I thought that we'd be fine
That I'd forget the thing that you said
I tried crossing out your words
But baby, you can not forget the past
Can not forget the past
Still, baby.

I'm so unpredictable, you don't know what to think
So unemotional, wonder if I'm still in love
You see, I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder these second time around
I'm so unpredictable, just like you used to be
So unemotional, boy I can't forget the way you were with me
I don't know what to tell you know
It's always harder this second time around

This second time around

We tried going back to Joes
That was always our favorite place
Long rides, baby by the coast
Do you remember where we stayed?
Last time, we were hanging out
You were acting kind of strange
Now it's the second time around
I'm starting to see, it's me that feels this way
(My heart just speaks to me)
It's me that feels this way
I know that you are the one that is brave

I'm so unpredictable, you don't know what to think
So unemotional, wonder if I'm still in love
You see, I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder these second time around
I'm so unpredictable, just like you used to be
So unemotional, boy I can't forget the way you were with me
I don't know what to tell you know
It's always harder these second time around

I'm not sure the best way to say this
But I can't pretend to love you no more, babe
This Ferris wheels got me crazy
Maybe the second time around is not meant for us, baby
Not meant for us, baby

I'm so unpredictable, you don't know what to think
So unemotional, wonder if I'm still in love
You see, I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder these second time around
I'm so unpredictable, just like you used to be
So unemotional, boy I can't forget the way you were with me
I don't know what to tell you know
